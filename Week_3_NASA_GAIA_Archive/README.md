# GAIA and NASA Exoplanet Archive #
In week 3, we learned how to analyze data from the GAIA and NASA Exoplanet Archives.

## NASA Exoplanet Archive ##
I used the archive available online to get parameters for confirmed exoplanets. I then plotted the parameters to analyze patterns and trends in the data.

### Mass v. Radii Plot ###

From this plot, we can see that there is a gap between two sections along the planet radii axis. This is possibly due to the existence of both rocky and gas planets.

### Semi-Major Axis v. Orbital Period Plot ###

### Orbital Period v. Orbital Eccentricity Plot ###

## GAIA Archive ##

### Color Magnitude Diagram ###
Here, I created a Color-Magnitude Diagram for the 10,000 closest stars to our solar system. The blue points are the 10 closest stars to us.

We were then given a challenge to recreate the Color-Magnitude Diagram found in a research paper. The diagram in the paper included all the data from the GAIA archive, but we only used 100,000. This was created with the help of a mentor, Sarah Blunt.
