# Introduction to Astronomy Research #
## Summer 2018 Exoplanet Research Program Work ##
Over the summer, I was able to participate in a research program created by Howard Isaacson, a UC Berkeley researcher in the Department of Astronomy. Over the course of 10 weeks, I learned valuable research skills tailored to research in exoplanets. I worked on projects and worked with large data sets from planet-finding telescopes using Python and R.
