# Introduction to Astronomy Research #
## Summer 2018 Exoplanet Research Program Work ##
Over the summer, I was able to participate in a research program created by Howard Isaacson, a UC Berkeley researcher in the Department of Astronomy. Over the course of 10 weeks, I learned valuable research skills tailored to research in exoplanets. I worked on projects and worked with large data sets from planet-finding telescopes using Python and R.

In this repository, you can find the work and projects I developed through the summer. 

Additionally, I worked on a research proposal as my final project which you can find [here](https://github.com/justinkadi/introtoastro/files/2408443/Using_Transmission_Spectra_from_JWST_to_Examine_Biosignatures_on_Europa.pdf).
I proposed a way to study biosignatures in Europa's geyser plumes using the James Webb Space Telescope to obtain transmission spectra.
